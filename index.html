            <p>Wow! <em>Is this really Frodo's home?</em> No, silly, this is just a stock image of a really lovely
                Hobbit Home located in New Zealand. However if it was Frodo's home, that would be really impressive.</p>

            <p>In the books Frodo and gang meet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Bombadil">Tom Bombadil</a>
                who can wear The Ring without disappearing or being tempted by it. How does that work you say? Perhaps
                he's older than the trees. Maybe he's magic. Either way, if the council handed Tom the ring, he would
                have just thrown it away and carried on with his business of being older than the acorns.</p>

            <h2>Bilbo's Home</h2>
            <div class='hobbitimg'>
                <img src='images/hobbit_home_2.jpg' />
            </div>

            <p>This isn't Bilbo's house either, but it really looks like it could be. And that blue door, a nice touch I
                would say. As many people know, Bilbo wrote a book about his adventures and when he found the ring that
                basically ruined his life and his cousin's life as well (yes, they were cousin's and not uncle /
                nephew). Bla bla bla, <strong>yes he saved the world from total evil and darkness,</strong> but kinda
                got a bum deal out of it. Here's a riddle from his meeting with Gollum.
            <blockquote>A box without hinges, key or lid, Yet golden treasure inside is hid. <b>Answer: Egg.</b>
            </blockquote>
            </p>

            <p>Alright, alright yeah yeah. He and Frodo got to go live with the Elves and ride on that boat, so maybe
                not totally a ruined life.</p>

            <h2>Peregrin's Home</h2>
            <div class='hobbitimg'>
                <img src='images/hobbit_home_3.jpg' />
            </div>

            <p>You know after all his adventures, I could see Peregrin living in a tiny home such as this one, but I
                would expect he might want to paint his door maybe a different colour. My first dog was named Pippin,
                after Peregrin Took. He became the 32nd Thane of the Shire for 50 years. Well done, Pippin.</p>

            <h2>Merry's Home</h2>
            <div class='hobbitimg'>
                <img src='images/hobbit_home_4.jpg' />
            </div>

            <p>Oh Meriadoc, a kind soul and the most perceptive of the group of Hobbit's that found themselves on a
                journey. Because he and Pippin drank a ton of Entwater, they ended up being the tallest Hobbit's when
                they returned back to The Shire. This made them fine catches and ended up marrying beautiful Hobbit
                ladies. Oh lala!</p>

            <h2>Sam's Home</h2>
            <div class='hobbitimg'>
                <img src='images/hobbit_home_5.jpg' />
            </div>

            <p>Sam was Frodo's Gardener and his best friend. He always, I mean ALWAYS had something to say about
                everything.
            <blockquote> "I know we are going to take a very long road, into darkness; but I know I can't turn back. It
                isn't to see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that I want â€“ I don't rightly know what I want: but
                I have something to do before the end, and it lies ahead, not in the Shire."</blockquote> <em>Sure.</em>
            </p>

            <p>Without Sam, we would all have been eaten by Uruk-hai. I do appreciate his determination and support to
                our wary hero. And found it great that ultimately he ended up dating <a
                    href="https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Joyce_Byers">Joyce Byers</a> and again showing how
                brave and loyal he was. I guess being a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ2j4oWdQtU">Pirate
                    Treasure Hunter</a> to save his Pacific Northwest costal town from being sold to developers as a
                child really shapes who you become as a grown-up. </p>

            </div>

            <p>Who's that? I don't know, and he's a Sackville-Baggin, and we all know we don't give them the time of
                day.</p>
